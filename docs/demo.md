# Demo

Below is a live preview of how the PageBuilderJS component looks and behaves. This is a static example embedding the Web Component directly.

## 📦 Minimal Integration

You can include the builder directly into any HTML page:

```html
<script src="/PageBuilderJS/block-builder.umd.js"></script>
<block-builder
  modules="[]"
  toolbar="[]"
  content='[]'>
</block-builder>
```
